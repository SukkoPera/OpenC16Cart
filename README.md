### Summary
> Like all the other Commodore 8-bit system, the Plus/4 had a cartridge port for ROM-based software. Because the computer did not do well in the marketplace, however, very few were released. - Bo Zimmerman

One day I decided to fix my old Commodore 16. I found out about [Diag264](http://inchocks.co.uk/commodore/Diag264/HTMLManual/Diag264.htm) and, since I knew that C16 carts weren't exactly common (I have never seen one "in the flesh"!), I was somewhat surprised to learn that [people are deliberately destroying genuine carts to use them as donors to build a Diag264](http://blog.tynemouthsoftware.co.uk/2014/03/commodore-264-c16-and-plus-4-diagnostic.html).

Since I had already built an [Open Hardware cartridge for the Commodore 64](https://github.com/SukkoPera/OpenC64Cart), I thought that one for the C16 could not be much different, and so this project was born.

Since I did not own a cartridge, I set out to find images of PCBs of real cartridges on the Net, only to find out that those are rare as well. In the end I found a couple of [top](https://github.com/SukkoPera/OpenC16Cart/blob/master/doc/inspiration-top.jpg)+[bottom](https://github.com/SukkoPera/OpenC16Cart/blob/master/doc/inspiration-bottom.jpg) images, and started to reverse engineer the design from those. With the help of [some service manuals](http://www.zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/schematics/computers/plus4/index.html), I came up with OpenC16Cart. I then expanded it to have the ability of using bigger (E(E))PROMs which could store multiple ROM images.
